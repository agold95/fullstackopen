Some tools you can use for code linting are things like ESLint for JavaScript code, or Pylint for Python code. They analysis tools that are used to spot stylistic errors or bugs that might appear when writing code. For testing there are many options like Jest for JavaScript front-end and back-end testing, or Cypress for end-to-end testing. For building there are even more options, like using GitHub to store code with the option to deploy it, or other ones like Docker, which is an open platform and an all-in-one option for testing, building, and deploying.

There are several other options for implementing CI other than Jenkins or Github Actions like AWS CodePipeline, a cloud-based CI service created by Amazon, Azure DevOps which can be either cloud-based or server-based created by Microsoft and aimed more towards enterprise software, or GitLab, which is a more open-sourced and cloud-based option available.

For this hypothetical project with a team of six people, it really depends on what kind of project it is, but since it will most likely be some sort of web-based project it would make more sense to set up a cloud-based environment than a self-hosted one. A cloud-based environment will make it easier for deployment and monitoring, plus the benefit of not having to purchase and run servers. This can however be a drawback, and depending how complicated or large the project is can cost more in running the project on a cloud-based system than a self-hosted one.
